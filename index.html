          <p>Fashion designer Coco Chanel is famous for her timeless designs, trademark suits and
            little black dresses. In the 1920s, she launched her first perfume and eventually
            introduced the Chanel suit and the little black dress, with an emphasis on making clothes
             that were more comfortable for women. She herself became a much revered style icon
             known for her simple yet sophisticated outfits paired with great accessories, such
             as several strands of pearls.
             <br><br>
             Her first taste of clothing success came from a dress she fashioned out of an old
             jersey on a chilly day. In response to the many people who asked about where she got
             the dress, she offered to make one for them. “My fortune is built on that old jersey
             that I’d put on because it was cold in Deauville,” she once told author Paul Morand.
